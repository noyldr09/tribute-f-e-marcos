      <p id="tribute-info">Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos Senior was a Filipino politician who went on to serve as the president of the country for twenty one years. Marcos’ father was lawyer and politician in his own right and he followed in his father’s footsteps both
        in terms of his choice of education as well as career choice. Marcos had a brush with the law early on in his life when he was accused of being involved in the murder of one of his father’s political opponents but he managed to defend himself
        and was acquitted. He served in the army during the Second World War and used that stint as campaigning tools at the time of his first presidential campaign. Marcos served as the president for two terms and during his second term he imposed martial
        law in the country in order to quell the threats posed by protesting groups and after lifting martial law, he won the presidential elections for the third time.

      <p><b><br>Childhood & Early Life</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Ferdinand Edralin Marcos was born to Mariano Marcos and his wife Josefa Edralin in Sarrat, IlocosNorte, Philippines on 11 September 1917. Marcos’ father was a qualified lawyer and also one of the leading politicians in Philippines.</li>
          <li>Marcos studied at some of the best schools in the capital of Philippines in Manila but the names of the schools are unknown. Later on, he went on to study law, like his father, at the University of the Philippines at some point in the latter
            part of the 1930s. He was excelled in extra-curricular activities and revelled in boxing, swimming and debating.</li>
          <li>In 1933, one of his father’s political rivals who had managed to defeat Mariano Marcos in an election was murdered. Ferdinand Marcos was accused and prosecuted for having colluded in the murder. He was found guilty but he defended himself in
            court. He was acquitted six years after the alleged murder took place.</li>
      </p>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Career</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Marcos joined the Philippine army after the commencement of the Second World War and served as an officer for the duration of the war.</li>
          <li>Following Philippines’ independence and the end of the Second World War, Ferdinand Marcos joined politics. He entered the House of Representatives from Ilocos Norte in 1949 and over the next ten years he was elected to the house two more times.
            During that decade, he served in different important capacities like the Chairman of House Committee on Commerce and Industry, member of the defence committee and several other committees.</li>
          <li>In 1959, Marcos became a member of the Philippine Senate and before long he became the floor leader of the minority. Two years after getting into the senate, the Liberal Party made him their executive vice president and two years after that
            he became the Senate President. During his two year long stint as the president of the Senate, Marcos was responsible for the introduction of a number of new bills.</li>
          <li>In 1965, Marcos was elected as the President of Philippines and during his campaign for the presidency, he stressed on his past as a soldier and the campaign proved to be successful. A year after assuming the presidency, Marcos sent Philippine
            soldiers to serve in the Vietnam War where they served for four years.</li>
          <li>Marcos became the president for a second term in 1969 and the very next year he had to face opposition and protests from the left wing. The protests, along with Islamic threats, were one of the main reasons why Marcos imposed martial law in
            Philippines three years after beginning his 2nd term and for the next nine years the country was under martial law as Marcos tried to establish a ‘New Society’. Opposition leaders and left wing activists were arrested, media was censored and
            even the Congress was closed down.</li>
          <li>Ferdinand Marcos became the Prime Minister of Philippines in 1978 and made sure that he made the position as powerful as that of the president of the country by transferring those powers to his office. Three years later, martial law was suspended
            and presidential elections were called. Marcos won the election by a big margin.</li>
          <li>Marcos’ third term as the president of Philippines ran into trouble in 1985 when there was an attempt to impeach him for stealing state assets to the tune of millions but a committee struck it down. The same year, Marcos called for elections
            ahead of schedule and duly won it, however there were allegations of electoral corruption. The failure of the electoral process gave further power to the ‘People Power Movement’. A year after the election, the opposition overtook the city
            and Marcos fled. He found asylum in Hawaii.

      </ul>
      <p><b>Personal Life & Legacy</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Marcos got married to Imelda Romualdez in 1954. His wife Imelda also went on to become a politician. The couple had four children named - Ma Imelda Marcos, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Irene Marcos and Aimee Marcos.</li>
          <li>Marcos died on 28 September 1989 in Honolulu after suffering from heart and kidney problems.</li>
